## Introduction
We designed a Parkour-like game similar to "Subway Surfers". But instead of controlling the role in the game by scrolling the screen, you have to move your body to control the role in the game. Please follow the procedure to set up the game in your own PC. If you have any problem, or want to know how the game was designed, refer to ``Report.pdf``.  

## Procedure
### Motion Detection Part
First, you will need these files: ``main.cpp``, both ``motion_detection.cpp`` and ``motion_detection.h`` in the Motion Detection folder, and both ``my_filter.cpp`` and ``my_filter.h`` in the Filter folder. During executing ``main.cpp``, it will call the other four files, so make sure that you put all of these five files in the same folder.  

### Data Transfer Part
  
### Game Part
First, open ``cmd/terminal`` and type ``pip install ursina`` to download Ursina.Then download the Game folder, or download the ``main.py`` and assests folder, and put them under a mutual folder. Then replace the IP address with your computer's IP address in line 268 in ``main.py``. After these steps you should able to execute ``main.py`` and enjoy this game.
