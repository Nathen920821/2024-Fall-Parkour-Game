## Introduction
We designed a Parkour-like game similar to "Subway Surfers". But instead of controlling the role in the game by scrolling the screen, you have to move your body to control the role in the game. Please follow the procedure to set up the game in your own PC. If you have any problem, or want to know how the game was designed, refer to the "Report.pdf" file.  

## Procedure
### Motion Detection Part
First, go to the motion detection file. You'll need four files: "motion_detection.cpp", "motion_detection.h", "my_filter.cpp", and "my_filter.h". The former two are for motion detection, and the latter two are for data filtering.  
### Data Transfer Part
  
### Game Part
